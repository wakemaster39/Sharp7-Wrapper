# Sharp7-Wrapper
Wrapper around Sharp7 to easily convert data to and from a PLC. Code base includes the pure C# implementation of snap7, [Sharp7](http://snap7.sourceforge.net/).

Code is based on [s7netplus](https://github.com/killnine/s7netplus/tree/master/S7.Net) which is also based on [s7.net](http://s7net.codeplex.com/).

I created this version to remove the dependency of snap7 and instead use sharp7. It is a work in progress but is currently functioning in it basic form in a production environment.
